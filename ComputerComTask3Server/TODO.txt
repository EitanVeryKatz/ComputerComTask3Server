char* token;
for((token = strtok(nullptr, "\r\n");token;token = strtok(nullptr, "\r\n"));//gets header from buffer

   size_t n = strlen(token) + 1;/finds len
   char* headerLine = new char[n];//allocate mem
   strcpy(headerLine, token);//copies to alocated mem
   headers.push_back(headerLine);//pushback
}

done:
1.update struct to include action and uri
2.add parsing function
3.in recieve: activate parsing and and status code <--
6.in send: add switch case for action

body: 

did a little cosmetic changes to recv (didnt interfere w/ your logic).
added procces request func in send (rerrouts to procces based on verb(switchcase))
noticed what you told me about the while loop, fixed it.
