5.write html in all suppurted langs
6.in send: add switch case for action
7.in send: for action add handling

done:
1.update struct to include action and uri
2.add parsing function
3.in recieve: activate parsing and and status code <--

body: 

now the parsing function Updates fields in class and returns 400 if request invalid or 0 else;

I think I finished everything needed in receive, because handling message is in sendmessage() function.
waiting on your thoughts.
