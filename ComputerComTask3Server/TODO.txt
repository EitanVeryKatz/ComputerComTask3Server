To Do:

1.write htmls
2.add endpoints for each http verb supported;

done:
1.update struct to include action and uri
2.add parsing function
3.in recieve: activate parsing and and status code <--
6.in send: add switch case for action

body: 

did a little cosmetic changes to recv (didnt interfere w/ your logic).
added procces request func in send (rerrouts to procces based on verb(switchcase))
noticed what you told me about the while loop, fixed it.


*Didn't run anything yet
** we need to delegate between us the endpoints and to figure out what will the usage protocol for our server will be.
